Howdy! I'm Dr. Rachael Tatman, a developer and data science educator who specilizes in language technology. I like to say I "make NLP boring": I want us all to build (and be able to use!) reliable, useful language technology tools that genuinely improve people's lives.

Previously I've been a developer advocate for [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) and both developer advocate and data scientist at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman). I have also done research in [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts.

I stream on both [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rctatman/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RachaelTatmanNLP) and I've love to see you there! My current streaming sechdule (as of May 31st 2022) is: 

- NLP or ML deep dive on Tuesdays at 7 AM Pacific/10 AM Eastern/7:30 PM IST
- NLP & ML week in view on Thursdays at 7 AM Pacific/10 AM Eastern/7:30 PM IST

The best way to keep up with me is [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rctatman) or [Mastedon](https://mastodon.rctatman.com/@rctatman).

<div style="line-height: 2;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16pt;font-style: italic;">Hello everyone, I’m Tao Zeng, an Associate Professor and Master’s Supervisor at the School of Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, affiliated with the Department of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering.<br/><br/>My research focuses on two “silent materials” — soil and concrete, with a particular emphasis on their behavior under extreme environmental conditions. I am especially interested in how these materials respond under coupled multi-physical fields (such as mechanical, thermal, and fluid) in complex scenarios like deep underground engineering, hydraulic fracturing, carbon sequestration, and geothermal energy extraction.<br/><br/>My academic journey began in the Department of Civil Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology. I then obtained my Master’s degree in Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Protection Engineering from Hohai University, and later earned a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from Université Lille 1 (France), under the supervision of Professor Jianfu Shao, a Fellow of the European Academy of Sciences. After completing my doctorate, I conducted research at TOTAL Research Center (France) and the Laboratory of Mechanics of Lille.<br/><br/>Since returning to China in 2016, I initially worked at Northwestern Polytechnical University, and in 2020, I joined Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, where I currently serve as a Master’s supervisor. From 2022 to 2023, I was seconded for one year to the China Electronics Engineering Design Institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, serving as Deputy Director of the Department of Scientific Research and Development.<br/><br/>In terms of teaching, I deliver undergraduate courses such as Foundation Engineering, Engineering Geology, and Soil Mechanics (the following two courses are international courses). For graduate students, I teach Underground Engineering and Slope Engineering.<br/><br/>I currently serve as a member of the Technical Committee on Multi-Field Coupling in Geotechnical Bodies under the Chinese Society for Rock Mechanics and Engineering, and I am a council member of the Shaanxi Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering. Additionally, I am on the Youth Editorial Board of the Journal of Xi’an University of Science and Technology, and I have been involved in various research projects related to geotechnical engineering and underground space development.<br/><br/></div><div style="line-height: 2;font-family: Calibri;font-size: 16pt;font-style: italic;font-weight: bold">If you are also interested in geotechnical engineering, deep underground resource development, or multi-physics coupling—topics that may sound complicated but are truly fascinating—feel free to reach out. I’d be happy to have a conversation!</div>

### Do you work on, or want to work on, language technology? Check out my book (w/ free bonus checklist) [The 9 Most Common Language Technology Mistakes (and how to avoid them!)](https://ko-fi.com/s/ba37783585). It's a quick read and I've worked really hard to distill down only the most important & time saving advice. ðŸ˜Š

Howdy! I'm Dr. Rachael Tatman and I'm a language technology educator. I like to say I "make NLP boring": I want us all to build (and be able to use!) reliable, useful language technology tools that genuinely improve people's lives.

I stream on both [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RachaelTatmanNLP) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rctatman/)  and I've love to see you there! My current streaming sechdule (as of May 31st 2022) is: 

- NLP or ML deep dive on Tuesdays at 7 AM Pacific/10 AM Eastern/7:30 PM IST
- NLP & ML week in review on Thursdays at 7 AM Pacific/10 AM Eastern/7:30 PM IST. This is also avaliable as a podcast through [RSS](https://feeds.listenbox.app/rss/hK2ysaCcZQTv/audio.rss), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2AXqJs0bZ3TgSJKsHnS4qk) or [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/coffee-chat-machine-learning-natural-language-processing/id1648157556).

The best way to keep up with me is [by subscribing to my (very infrequent) newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/rctatman). You can also follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rctatman) or <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.rctatman.com/@rctatman">Mastodon</a>. If you'd like to support my work, the best way is [through my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/rctatman/tiers).

Previously I've been a developer advocate for [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) and both developer advocate and data scientist at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman). I have also published research in [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts. Full text of most of my papers are avaliable under the "Publications" tab.
